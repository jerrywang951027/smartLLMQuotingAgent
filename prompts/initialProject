1.create a full stack applicaiton project with nodejs for backend and react for frontend
2.This application should work an agent using langchain framework
3.Agent should have the capability to switch between most populare LLM model like gemini,gpt,claude
4. Agent should be able to load MCP servers based on JSON configurations like salesforce
5. Upon user's input from frontend, agent should do the reasoning and act and determine when to invoke which tool from 
   configured MCP servers
6. authentication to access all LLM should be covered
7. authentication to invoke MCP servers should also be covered
8. I need to start the application with both frontend and backend in one command
9. all authentication information should be stored in .env file 
10, need to support communicating with MCP server using both STDIO and HTTP protocols.
11. Frontend is simple for now, will jsut be a  chat window allowing user to typing in prompt and display 
    response from agent.
